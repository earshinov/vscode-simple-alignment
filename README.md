# Simple Alignment

This extension allows you to align multiple selections into columns. It is strongly inspired by the [Alignment][sublimealignment] extension for Sublime Text.

Unlike other extensions for VS Code like [Alignment][] and [Better Align][], this one does not decide for you what and how to align, and lets you have everything under control.

The functionality is available via the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P > "Align") or a keybinding `Ctrl+Alt+A`. You can always change the keybinding via Ctrl+Shift+P > "Preferences: Open Keyboard Shortcuts".

_Note_: This extension requires using multiple selections / cursors. If you are not familiar with this concept, [Basic Editing][] docs is a good place to start.

You can find this extension both in the [Visual Studio Marketplace][] and in the [Open VSX Registry][].
